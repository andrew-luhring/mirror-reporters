Mirror Reporters v.0.0.1
========================

Google Glass + [Mocha, karma, jshint].reporter
--------------------


Before you get too excited:

**There is currently nothing to show**

Nothing works.

The reporters have not been formed into existence yet- when they exist and work properly, this README will be updated (and the reporters will be submitted to their respective parent applications).

That being said-

I'd love some help :-).

This project is closely based off of  Alexander Scott's [mirror-quickstart-nodejs](https://github.com/alexanderscott/mirror-quickstart-nodejs)
 ...which is largely based off of Google's [mirror-quickstart-ruby](https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/ruby).
